🍫 ChocoCrunch Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing the nutritional composition, brand distribution, and processing levels of food products in the ChocoCrunch dataset.
The goal was to design an interactive data visualization dashboard that connects product-level information with nutritional insights and health risk indicators using three main data tables — product_info_clean, nutrient_info_clean, and derived_metrics.

The project contains multiple analytical pages, each built to provide specific perspectives.

📊 Page 1 – Overview Dashboard:
Gives a summary of total products, total brands, high-sugar product count, and percentage of ultra-processed foods.
Visuals include doughnut charts for calorie and sugar categories, brand-wise product counts, and slicers for quick filtering.
It helps users explore how product types and brands contribute to the overall market distribution.

🥦 Page 2 – Nutritional Insights:
Provides deeper understanding of energy, fat, sugar, and nutrient composition.
Charts such as bar, column, and scatter visuals highlight calorie distribution, nutrient relationships, and average nutrient patterns across categories.
This page reveals how energy, fat, and sugar values vary among different food groups.

🍽 Page 3 – NOVA Groups & Health Risk Analysis:
Focuses on food processing levels (NOVA 2 to 4) and their impact on nutrition quality.
Interactive visuals show product counts, average calories, nutrition scores, and sugar content across groups.
Additional visuals, such as a combo chart comparing calories vs nutrition score, emphasize the trade-off between energy density and health quality.

🏷 Page 4 – Brand Insights & Market Trends:
Highlights brand-level performance and processing patterns using dynamic bar and pie charts.
Users can identify top brands, high-calorie products, and the share of ultra-processed items.

Overall, this Power BI dashboard demonstrates the connection between nutritional balance, processing intensity, and brand presence, turning raw data into actionable, visual insights for healthier and smarter food choices.
